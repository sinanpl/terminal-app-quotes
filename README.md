This is a simple app I created to explore 
client apps that can be called from the terminal
with `pyproject.toml`. 


#### Set-up
1. request an API key from https://api-ninjas.com/
2. add the key to env:

    ```
    export API_NINJAS_KEY=********
    ```
3. install the package with `python -m pip install /path/to/folder`

#### Run from terminal
